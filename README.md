Project Description

This project focuses on predicting future stock values by training machine learning algorithms on historical data. The aim is to identify the best 5 stocks for a specified period, considering daily price changes and percentage fluctuations. Additionally, the project compares the prediction accuracy between Tensorflow (Keras library) and Scikit-Learn (Regression library).
